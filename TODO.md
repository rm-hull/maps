# Ideas / TODO's

- Add a **debug** tab to the settings with some instructions about what effect setting the debug flags would do.
  - Store debug flags in general settings
  - Make layers control sticky (i.e. conditionally ignore `onMouseLeave` events)

- Improve search function - rather than just flying to the first matched entry, if there are multiple matches,
  pop up a listbox and let the user pick which one.
  - Additionally, show a marker pin for the selected location, with a `<PointOfInterest/>` pop-out.
  - Implement auto-complete / auto-suggest on the search function as the user types.

- Add tests.

- Fix outstanding eslint issues.
  - Improve/rationalize eslint config

- Improve README.md front material.
